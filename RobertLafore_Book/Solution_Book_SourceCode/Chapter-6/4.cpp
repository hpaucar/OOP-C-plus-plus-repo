/*
Create an employee class, basing it on Exercise 4 of Chapter 4. The member data should
comprise an int for storing the employee number and a float for storing the employeeâ€™s
compensation. Member functions should allow the user to enter this data and display it.
Write a main() that allows the user to enter data for three employees and display it.
