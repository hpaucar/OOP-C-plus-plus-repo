/*If you have two fractions, a/b and c/d, their sum can be obtained from the formula
Write a program that encourages the user to enter two fractions, and then displays their
sum in fractional form. (You donâ€™t need to reduce it to lowest terms.) The interaction
with the user might look like this:
Enter first fraction: 1/2
Enter second fraction: 2/5
Sum = 9/10
You can take advantage of the fact that the extraction operator ( >> ) can be chained to
read in more than one quantity at once:
cin >> a >> dummychar >> b;*/

#include<iostream>

using namespace std;

int main(){
	int a, b, c, d;
	char temp;
	cout << "Enter first fraction: ";
	cin >> a >> temp >> b;
	cout << "Enter second fraction: ";
	cin >> c >> temp >> d;

	int num = a * d + b * c;
	int den = b * d;
	cout << "Sum is: " << num << "/" << den << endl;
	
	return 0;
}
